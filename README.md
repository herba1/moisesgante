## Client Testimonial

> "Working as Herbart's client to develop my art website was great! He asked clear, detailed questions to gauge my thoughts and preferences, and was able to elaborate if I was uncertain or confused. Herbart was very efficient, and gave many progress updates over the span of the month we worked together. He captured my ideas amazingly, and went above and beyond in areas where I gave him creative freedom. The colors and animations of the website are very aesthetically pleasing just as I was hoping, so I'm happy with the results!"
