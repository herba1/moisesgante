# Moises Gante Art Portfolio Case Study

The Moises Gante Art Portfolio is a custom artist website that showcases the work of a talented visual artist from Madera, California. I handled the complete development process, transforming the client's artistic vision into a professional digital presence that captures their aesthetic while providing an immersive gallery experience.

This project was built using modern web technologies including Next.js 15, React 19, and Sanity CMS for content management. I handled the complete design process in Figma, creating wireframes and iterating on layouts before development. I implemented custom GSAP animations, smooth scrolling with Lenis, and a fully responsive design. The site features dynamic artwork galleries, an interactive hero section, and a headless CMS that allows the client to manage content independently.

Throughout the month-long development process, I maintained regular client communication and delivered a high-performance website that exceeded expectations. The client noted my efficiency, clear communication, and ability to capture their ideas while providing creative freedom in areas like animations and color schemes, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing final product. The site achieved 165 visitors and 1,060 page views in its first 30 days with a 41% engagement rate.
